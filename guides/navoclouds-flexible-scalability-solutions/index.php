    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-300 mb-2">Why Scalability Matters</h3>
    <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
      Scalability ensures that your server resources can adapt to fluctuations in demand. Without scalable solutions, your services may suffer from downtime or slow performance during traffic spikes. At Navocloud, our infrastructure allows you to scale seamlessly, ensuring consistent performance even during high demand.
