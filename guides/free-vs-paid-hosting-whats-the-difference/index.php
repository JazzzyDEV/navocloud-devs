    In recent times, there has been the case of new companies emerging that not only host your servers and data for you for free, such as Aternos, others, and now NavoCloud. These options have led server hosting and data hosting for less financially inclined individuals to not only do so but to be accessible in a more friendly fashion from which to learn. Sure, oftentimes these hosting options are fleeting and temporary, but that doesn't change that very important point: it's accessible. However, it's not without its disadvantages.

    Paid hosting, on the other hand, of which there are too many to note for any need you require, from game hosting, web hosting, VPS needs, or otherwise. A lot of the advantages come with not only more options available to you, but security and peace of mind that your data will be available to you within a particular grace period. In paying for a service, you not only get these options and security but you're often funding these companies to provide a better service to you. Such is the case of Game Hosting: you're helping pay for more accessible tools to enjoy the games you are playing.

    Both types of hosting come with clear advantages and disadvantages, some are stated here, some are not. The author of the post is not a negative individual; however, I will express a clear point that bears constant repeating both in the Hosting industry and in real life: <strong>You get what you pay for.</strong> Be cognizant-ly aware of this and you'll find what works for you and maybe your friends. Such is the case of the recent start-up, HelHosting. You'd not only be paying for quality game hosting, but facilitating their ability to provide better tools and services to you.
